#
# For a new metric_info you have to choose a color. No more hex-codes are needed!
# Instead you can choose a number of the above color ring and a letter 'a' or 'b
# where 'a' represents the basic color and 'b' is a nuance/shading of the basic color.
# Both number and letter must be declared!
#
# Example:
# "color" : "23/a" (basic color yellow)
# "color" : "23/b" (nuance of color yellow)
