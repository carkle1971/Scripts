This is an extention for PFsense. If used together with SNMP you have a lot of info. This is build for reading the OpenVPN server status and sysstem info

The VPN server has to have a discription!!!

Setup/Agents/Other integrations/PFSense via WebAPI

I just make and change scripts for personal use. I do not support the scripts in anyway. Just don't have time.

Enjoy!
